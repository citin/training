# My Code Gym

Here are my solutions to some code training exercises in Ruby.

The sites I use for training:

- [Hacker Rank](https://www.hackerrank.com): good exercises to resolve and code discussions.
- [Codility](https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons): has the best exercises and evaluates performance.
- [Code Wars](https://www.codewars.com/): the exercises are not so good, but has the better solutions comparisons.
- [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net): has very interesting problems to solve, but without code solutions.
- [Code Signal](https://codesignal.com)
