# My Code Gym

Here are my solutions to some code training exercises in Ruby.

The sites I use for training:

[Hacker Rank](https://www.hackerrank.com)
- Good exercises to resolve and code discussions.
[Codility](https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons)
- Has the best exercises and evaluates performance.
[Code Wars](https://www.codewars.com/)
- The exercises are not so good, but has the better solutions comparisons.
[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net)
- Has very interesting problems to solve, but without code solutions.
